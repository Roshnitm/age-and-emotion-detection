# age-and-emotion-detection
to detect age and emotion of the person using live camera
ABSTRACT:

This project develops a real-time facial recognition system that detects emotions and estimates age using live webcam input. It combines OpenCV for facial detection, Deepfake for emotion recognition and age estimation, and NumPy for efficient image data processing, all integrated into a web application built with Flask. Users can capture their image via webcam, and the system instantly analyses and displays the dominant emotion and estimated age on the webpage. This system is designed for applications in customer experience enhancement, human-computer interaction, and security, offering a user-friendly interface and robust performance powered by deep learning.
REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION:
•	Software: Python, Flask, OpenCV, DeepFace, NumPy
•	Hardware: Webcam for real-time capture
•	Libraries: deepface, opencv-python, numpy, flask, werkzeug
•	Other Tools: Code editor (VS Code), Browser for testing.

ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURE:
1.	Frontend: Captures image via webcam or allows uploading an image.
2.	Backend: Flask server processes the image, uses DeepFace for age and emotion analysis, and returns the results.
3.	Data Flow:
o	User uploads or captures an image.
o	Image is analyzed by DeepFace.
o	Age and emotion results are sent back to the frontend for display.

MODEL DESCRIPTION:
The DeepFace library integrates state-of-the-art pre-trained models for facial recognition tasks. It supports models like VGG-Face, Google FaceNet, and OpenFace, allowing multi-task learning for age and emotion detection based on trained neural networks.
IMPLEMENTATION:
1.	Capture or upload an image via the web interface.
2.	Use the DeepFace analyze method to detect age and emotion.
3.	Display the result on the user interface in real-time.
